Interest on a credit card’s unpaid balance is calculated using the average dailybalance. Suppose that netBalance is the balance shown in the bill, payment isthe payment made, d1 is the number of days in the billing cycle, and d2is the number of days payment is made before billing cycle. Then, theaverage daily balance is:

averageDailyBalance = (netBalance * d1 – payment * d2)/d1

If the interest rate per month is, say, 0.0152, then the interest on theunpaid balance is:interest = averageDailyBalance * 0.0152

Write a program that accepts as input netBalance, payment, d1, d2, and interestrate per month. The program outputs the interest. Format your output to twodecimal places.
